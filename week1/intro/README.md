# introduction

An outline of what we're going to do:

| Week 1 : straw | Week 2 : distributions | Week 3 : FFNN | 
| :------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| you are here      | Gaussian, multinomial, softmax, sigmoid | polynomials (Bishop) |
| k-NN, perceptron, PCA, k-means | losses and likelihoods | RBFs |
| the curse | *(no lecture)*| MLPs |
| | | |
| **Week 4** |  **Week 5** |  **Week 6** | 
| **Week 4** |  **Week 5** |  **Week 6** | 
|| *(break)* ||

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

So (I think we would agree) that matrix multiplication looks something like this.
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b\\
c & d\\
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
e & f\\
g & h\\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
ae+bg & af+bh\\
ce+dg & cf+dh\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
