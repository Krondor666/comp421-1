# introduction

An outline of what we're going to do:

| Week 1 : straw | Week 2 : distributions | Week 3 : FFNN | 
| :------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| you are here      | Gaussian, multinomial, softmax, sigmoid | polynomials (Bishop) |
| k-NN, perceptron, PCA, k-means | losses and likelihoods | RBFs |
| the curse | *(no lecture)*| MLPs |
| | | |
| **Week 4** |  **Week 5** |  **Week 6** | 
| **Week 4** |  **Week 5** |  **Week 6** | 
|| *(break)* ||


| Week 4        | Week 5          | Week 6  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| stuff here     | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
