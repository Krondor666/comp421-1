# Perceptrons

We've just had lectures covering linear regression with "neurons", then to perceptrons for classification, then to a probabilistic view on what cost function (often called "loss") to use, then to back-propagation of errors through a multi-layered network.

How about we put working code relating to perceptrons, no matter how feeble it may seem to you, in here.

Github automatically renders ipython notebooks, which is unbearably cool.
