# week 2 practical session


we could try to make backprop GO:
   * from simple starter code, and
   * with Marsland's code, and
   * using scikit-learn, a python module for machine learning

we should experiment with:
   * can we make it over-fit?
   * can we replace the sigmoid with something else and make it go?
   * can we mess with the "loss function" and make it go?
