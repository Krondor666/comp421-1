# week 3 practical session


   *    we tried out metropolis algorithm on a "toy" 2-d problem that's easy to visualise
   * then we looked at the code that made the NN examples from lecture, see if it's understandable. 

It seemed to me that some students "got" Metropolis as an algorithm but could not see how it was useful in the context of Neural Nets, so we should revisit that at some point soon.
